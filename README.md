## Project Summary
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

In this project, we worked on a text clustering problem where we had to classify/group the Netflix movie/shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.

- The dataset contained about 7787 records, and 11 attributes.

- We began by dealing with the dataset's missing values and doing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- Creating cluster using following attributes: director, cast, country, genre, rating and description. The values in these attributes were tokenized, preprocessed, and then vectorized using TFIDF vectorizer.

- We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle the curse of dimensionality.

- We built Two types of clusters using the K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Heirachycal clustering algorithm and find out optimal number of clusters using diffrent technique such as elbow method, silhoutte score and dendogram etc.

- A content based recommender system was built using the similarity matrix obtained after using cosine similarity. This recommender system will make 10 recommendations to the user based on the type of show they watched.
